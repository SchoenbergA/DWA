### GeoRef Workflow

# Georef all DWA places translitration of place names
-> compare with Maurer (lvl1?)
-> if DWA place name is in Maurer, than put coordinates and GID from Maurer to DWA

# create DWA_places
-> merge AL and JH Georef data
used as base for translitaraion

# Comparison
-> Maurer places used actual level with mergMultiPlaces to compare to DWA
-> Issue: maurer lvlv chnaged so tha DWA doenst fit Maurer anymore in total
